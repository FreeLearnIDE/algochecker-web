    <h1>Important information</h1>
    <p>Algochecker is a system which performs automatic testing of programs submitted by users. In order to get along
        with it, you need to comply with these rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use only the programming languages allowed by the lecturer and upload only your source code unless
                explicitly asked otherwise.</li>
            <li>Your program must perform only actions which are described in the instruction</li>
            <li>Read the tasks very carefully and be very, very precise.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>More details are listed below.</p>
    <h2>Code submissions</h2>
    <p>Usually, you are requested to upload <strong>only</strong> the source code of your program. Depending on the
        programming language, the source files have the following extensions:</p>
    <table class="table table-striped">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>language</th>
            <th>extensions</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>C</td>
            <td><code>.c</code>, <code>.h</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>C++</td>
            <td><code>.cpp</code>, <code>.hpp</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Python</td>
            <td><code>.py</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Java</td>
            <td><code>.java</code></td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Unless asked explicitly, please do not upload any binaries and project files like <code>.exe</code>,
        <code>.obj</code> or <code>.cbp</code>.</p>
    <p>Also, your source code should contain everything, which is required for a program in order to be compilable. This
        means that all required headers (imports) have to be included, all definitions of custom functions must be
        provided etc.</p>
    <h2>Program output requirements</h2>
    <p>Similarly to the real world programming, each task has a very strictly defined "protocol". What does it mean in
        simple words?</p>
    <p>If you are asked to write a program in C language which reads two numbers and then prints a single number being
        the sum of these numbers, then you should do it like this:</p>
    <pre class="highlight-no-lines"><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">scanf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"%d %d"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"%d</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></pre>


    <p>Such solution is fully correct, but remember that your program is <strong>not allowed</strong> to print any
        additional text unless it is stated explicitly in the task description.</p>
    <p><strong>Do not write like this:</strong></p>
    <pre class="highlight-no-lines"><span></span><span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"The sum of numbers is: %d"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">);</span></pre>


    <p><strong>Also do not write like this:</strong></p>
    <pre class="highlight-no-lines"><span></span><span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Please enter the first number: "</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="c1">// ... some code which reads the number ...</span></pre>


    <p>Such program would be immediately marked as totally incorrect, because the task was to output <strong>just a
        number</strong>, nothing else. Similarly, if the task is to output <code>YES</code> and you would output <code>yes</code>
        or <code>Yes</code> instead then the answer is also considered improper.</p>
    <p>Your program is going to be automatically tested by a machine (and machines are "stupid"), so every mistake is
        treated as an error. For that reason, usually you have multiple possibilities to improve your code and send it
        again.</p>
    <p>Requirements stated above may sound silly, but during your potential work as a programmer, from time to time you
        may be asked to write a program in a very strict manner according to a specification. For instance, a program
        which produces an image (let's say a <code>.bmp</code> file) must do it perfectly according to the file format
        requirements. Any small mistake would cause the image not to be displayed, but you would see a "corrupted file"
        error instead. Because of this, being precise is a very important skill which will allow you to make a lot of
        money :)</p>
    <p>If you feel that the program is correct, but the Algochecker is still giving you 0% and you are starting to get
        mad, please use the <a href="{{ url('feedback') }}">Feedback</a> form (the link is also available at the bottom of each
        page). In the form, state which task you are fighting with, what your name is and shortly describe the problem.
    </p>
    <h2>Test result interpretation</h2>
    <p>After your program has been evaluated by the Algochecker, you are able to see the report created by the checking
        machine.</p>
    <p class="text-center"><img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="{{ static("webapp/img/help_viewreport.png") }}"></p>
    <p>The "Tests" table present in the report describes results of tests performed against your programs. If there are
        4 rows in the table, then it means that your program was tested using 4 different data sets.</p>
    <p class="text-center"><img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="{{ static("webapp/img/help_tests.png") }}"></p>
    <p>The screenshot presents the following situation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>two tests were passed successfully, so the program gave a proper result</li>
            <li>for some data the program gave wrong results, so "bad answer" label appeared</li>
            <li>for some other data the program hanged for more than 2 seconds, so the test was assumed to be failed</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Test grouping</h3>
    <p>Sometimes tests can be grouped. Naming convention for that is <code>{group_name}-{test_name}</code>.
        Grouping means that the group of tests is marked as it was a single test. For example, passing one test in a group
        consisting of two tests means that the whole group is failed.</p>
    <p><b>Reasoning:</b> this is done in order to prevent programs which output, say, static answer to a question which requires
        "yes" or "no" to get some reasonable score.</p>
    <p><b>Example:</b> consider the task which requires to output "yes" if an integer is divisible
        by 10 and "no" otherwise. For this task there are defined 4 tests. Two of them require answer "yes" and two â€” "no".
        So the program which outputs "yes" will get 50% of the score even though it does basically nothing.
    </p>
    <h3>Input data</h3>
    <p>There is no possibility to see what data caused the program to malfunction. The only option is to read the task
        once again and then read your code very carefully in order to find mistakes.</p>
    <p>Testing is always performed using valid sets of data. This means - using input data which satisfy all
        requirements described in the instruction for the task. If your program was not evaluated to 100% then you have to
        find some valid data set which causes program to work improperly.</p>
